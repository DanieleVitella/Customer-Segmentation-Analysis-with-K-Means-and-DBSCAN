# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-with-K-Means-and-DBSCAN

## **About Dataset**

### **Context**
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis. I will demonstrate this by using the unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm).

### **Content**
You own a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

### **Problem Statement**
As a mall owner, you want to find out the Target Customers to create promotions and sales to increase conversions.
